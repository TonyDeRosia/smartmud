| Adapter | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| canonical effect handler | PRODUCTION_WIRED | `AbilityRuntimeService` invokes `execute_effect_handler` after common lifecycle work. |
| damage component adapter | PRODUCTION_WIRED | Magic Missile dispatches through `_apply_damage_component` to combat runtime. |
| camp/campfire adapter | PRODUCTION_WIRED | Registered effects call the survival-needs authority. |
| legacy instant executor | PARTIALLY_WIRED | Retained for compatibility callers; production requests no longer delegate to it. |
