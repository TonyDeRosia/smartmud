## Live player state, death, recovery, and combat-start reconciliation

Smart MUD now uses a canonical `CharacterActionState` projection for command eligibility. The projection derives command-facing state from canonical Health, stored position/posture, lifecycle state, combat state, and active encounter evidence. It prevents handlers from making independent eligibility decisions from only one stale field.

Tony's Adventurer's Lair `update_pos()` behavior was audited from the current reference source: positive Health preserves active positions above stunned; positive Health in stunned-or-worse restores standing; Health 0 through -2 is stunned; -3 through -5 is incapacitated; -6 through -10 is mortally wounded; -11 or lower is dead. Smart MUD reproduces those thresholds in `engine.character_state` without copying C source.

Attack validation now reconciles the attacker's Health/position/lifecycle state before validating. Generic `You cannot attack right now.` has been replaced with specific player messages for sleeping, sitting, resting, stunned, incapacitated, mortally wounded, dead, already fighting, absent targets, dead targets, and protected targets. Failed validation is read-only and must not save the character; command history remains separate from character persistence.

Character entry registers a canonical resident actor and reconciles stale positive-HP down positions through the same state projection. The repair is logged as `[state-reconcile]` and marks resident state dirty for the coalesced autosave path rather than forcing an immediate SQLite write.

The runtime pulse continues to use the existing scheduler. Regeneration now reconciles position after resource recovery; incapacitated and mortally wounded actors take bounded periodic suffering damage and are reconciled after each suffering tick. Dead actors are excluded from ordinary regeneration.

Admin commands:

- `stateinspect <character>` reports current/persisted Health, stored/derived position, combat/lifecycle state, active encounter, attack eligibility, block reason, and proposed repair.
- `staterepair <character> --dry-run` reports safe repairs without mutation.
- `staterepair <character> --apply` applies unambiguous position reconciliation through the canonical service and is intended to be idempotent.
- `combatstate <character>` reports encounter/target state with the same projection.

Normal command:

- `condition` reports Health condition, canonical position, movement eligibility, and fight eligibility without exposing database internals.

Performance counters now include combat validation attempts/rejections, rejection-by-reason, failed/read-only/combat-validation save guards, state reconciliations, stale position/combat/encounter repair counters, positive-health incapacitated repairs, periodic suffering ticks, and recovery transitions.

Windows status: not executed in this Linux container. Tony should run the documented manual acceptance flow on Windows, inspect Kraevok with `stateinspect char_shattered_realms_kraevok`, dry-run and apply `staterepair` only if unambiguous, then verify `condition`, `score`, `kill fox`, specific rejection text, and `perfstat` failed-command save counters.


## Runtime heartbeat/combat parity update

See `docs/RUNTIME_HEARTBEAT.md` and `docs/CORPSE_AND_DEATH_LIFECYCLE.md` for the current TBA-style heartbeat mapping, pulse constants, resident authority rules, coalesced autosave, restore behavior, movement/flee cleanup, corpse decay, corpse parser parity, async-poll hints, focused tests, broad-suite status, Windows manual status, and remaining differences.

## Heartbeat combat correction pass (main-v2)

Tony's current Adventurer's Lair keeps a single 0.10 second game loop heartbeat. `heartbeat()` dispatches subsystems by pulse buckets: scripts, once-per-second MSDP, zones, idle password checks, mobiles, `PULSE_VIOLENCE`, hourly tick work (`weather_and_time`, affects, `point_update`, prompts, quests, auction), autosave, usage, time save, and `extract_pending_chars()` every pulse. Combat is held in a resident `combat_list`; `set_fighting()` links a character into that list, `stop_fighting()` unlinks it, and `perform_violence()` walks the list on the violence bucket rather than discovering fights from durable storage each base pulse. `do_kill`/offensive commands establish fighting; normal repeated swings are violence-pulse work. Death flows through `damage()`/`update_pos()`/`die()`/`raw_kill()`, creates corpses with NPC/player corpse timers, emits death cry, extracts pending characters, and lets object update/timers decay corpses. `do_restore` mutates the in-game target when present and does not make an offline pfile a live combatant merely by restoring it.

Smart MUD now preserves the existing 100ms base heartbeat but gates combat through `violence_pulse_count` (20 for Shattered Realms, approximately two seconds). Nonviolence heartbeats do not call active encounter processing and do not print `[violence-pulse]`. Bounded catch-up keeps the crossed violence bucket in the bounded loop so a delayed scheduler dispatches one due violence bucket without duplicates.

Combat timing is resident and pulse-owned. A command-created opening attack remains the direct command response. After that, each active resident participant may act once per global violence pulse unless defeated, fled, dead, in another room, waiting, defending, or using a queued action/cooldown. Weapon speed no longer adds a second encounter-level two-second timer; explicit wait/cooldown state is the skip mechanism.

The opening Health-to-1 workaround was removed. Lethal opening damage now remains lethal and immediately enters the RuntimeLifecycleService death path: fighting state is stopped, queued target actions are canceled, death/corpse/reward/quest-credit side effects are idempotent, and no later violence pulse is required to kill the target.

Active encounters are represented by typed resident encounters and participants. SQLite remains for initial checkpoints, administrative/audit history, completion, and idempotent death transactions, but violence processing no longer SELECTs active encounters or participant lists per base heartbeat. Combat history is buffered in memory and flushed in bounded batches or on encounter completion instead of synchronously inserting a history row for every hit.

Corpse timing uses durable UTC fields (`created_at_utc`, `decay_at_utc`). Monotonic time is only process-local scheduling input. Older corpse state is migrated conservatively on decay processing, expired corpses drop contents to the room, are removed from entity resolution, and are destroyed once.

NPC death output is ordered through the lifecycle path: final-hit text, collapse/death text, corpse creation, loot/reward/kill-credit side effects, encounter completion, and prompt/room invalidation. Player death uses the configured Adventurer's Lair position thresholds: positive health recovers above stunned, 0 to -2 stunned, -3 to -5 incapacitated, -6 to -10 mortally wounded, and -11 or lower dead; player corpse/loss/respawn policy remains explicit configuration and is not hidden in heartbeat code.

Point update remains a long-tick heartbeat subsystem and is delegated to RuntimeResourceService/formula configuration rather than hard-coded in the heartbeat. Restore now distinguishes online and offline targets: online restore mutates resident state and checkpoints deliberately; offline restore loads a temporary character, restores persistent fields, saves, and does not register a resident actor or regeneration/combat participant.

Test-resource cleanup keeps the runtime scheduler non-owning in MudRuntime; the FastAPI lifecycle owns async tasks. Focused heartbeat tests exercise shutdown by constructing temporary runtimes without starting extra scheduler threads.

SQL measurement counters for the resident hot path are exposed through `performance_counters`: active encounter SELECTs during violence processing remain at `combat_encounter_sql_reads == 0`; combat audit writes are counted as buffered/flushed rows; initial encounter checkpoints, final completion, death transactions, and autosaves remain permitted writes.

Windows manual acceptance was not performed in this Linux container. Tony should run `pulseinfo`, `pulsetrace`, `perfstat reset`, a live Emberwood Fox fight, corpse restart check, offline restore check, and the focused pytest group on Windows before declaring Windows acceptance.
