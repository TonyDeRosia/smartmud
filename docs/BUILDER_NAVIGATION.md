# Builder Navigation and Runtime Overlay

Phase 4B makes draft rooms visible through the runtime room graph for builder/admin/owner characters while Builder Mode is enabled. The lookup order is: BuilderWorkspace draft rooms first, then live world package rooms. Normal players continue to resolve only live world package rooms.

## Builder context

Builder context is tracked on the runtime character/session data: current room, last room, last created room, current area, current zone, and whether Builder Mode is enabled. Room creation, `goto`, `dig`, `link`, and `unlink` update this context through the runtime and BuilderWorkspace.

## Room navigation

`goto <room_id>` resolves exact room ids first. `goto <room name>` searches visible runtime room names. `goto here` shows the current draft/live source. `goto last` returns to the previous room when tracked. `goto home` returns to the live world start room. Successful `goto` persists the character location and renders the destination room through the canonical room renderer.

`rooms`/`rlist` lists live and draft rooms visible to the builder with id, name, area, zone, source, and exit count. `rfind`/`rsearch` search ids, names, descriptions, features, tags, area ids, and zone ids because they search merged room records.

## Map building

`dig <direction> <new_room_id> [room name] [--one-way]` creates a draft destination room when needed, links the current room to it, creates the reverse exit unless `--one-way` is present, moves the builder into the new room, and renders it.

`link <direction> <target_room_id>` creates a draft exit from the current room. `link both <direction> <target_room_id>` also creates the reverse exit. `unlink <direction>` removes the current draft exit.

`map`/`rmap` shows the current room and the eight basic adjacent directions: north, south, east, west, up, down, in, and out.

## Save, reload, and limits

`builder save` exports drafts under the builder workspace and does not promote or mutate live world package files. Promotion to live package is not implemented yet. `builder reload` refreshes use of saved drafts from BuilderWorkspace for the runtime overlay.

## Validation

`builder validate` reports draft graph issues such as missing names, broken exits, missing feature names, invalid item/entity fields, and invalid plugin JSON. Validation output is intended to be actionable before a future promotion workflow.

## Manual workflow

```text
builder on
rcreate test_room
rname Test Room
rdesc This is a test.
builder validate
builder snapshot
builder save
goto test_room
look

dig north north_road North Road
look

goto test_room
link north north_road
map
builder reload
```

`look` after `goto test_room` must render `Test Room`, not the starter room.

## Future work

Visual Builder UI, AI Builder, promotion to live packages, combat, quests, shops, and spellcasting remain future work.

## Phase 4C Canonical Room Graph Contract

Builder navigation now treats live package rooms plus builder draft rooms as one canonical runtime graph for builders with Builder Mode enabled. Rendering, `look`, movement, `goto`, `dig`, `link`, `unlink`, `map`/`rmap`, and validation must resolve exits from that same graph. If an exit is visible, movement uses that exact exit record or reports why it is blocked, closed, locked, hidden, missing a target, or pointing at a missing room.

Builder edit commands show a persistent `Currently editing:` block with room id, name, source, and dirty state. Room ids are lowercase underscore identifiers; human-readable room names belong in `rname` or the quoted room-name form of `dig`.
