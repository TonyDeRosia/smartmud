## Intentional Smart MUD divergence

Implemented: normal SCORE omits current HP, maximum HP, current Mana, maximum Mana, current Move/Stamina, maximum Move/Stamina, and Alignment. These systems remain canonical prompt/resource/combat systems and are not moved elsewhere in SCORE.

## Field authority matrix

| Field | Status | Canonical authority | Persistence source | Gameplay consumer | Projection dependency | Invalidation reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Name/title | Implemented | CharacterDisplaySnapshotService | characters/data identity | command/session identity | identity,title | identity/title mutation |
| Race | Partial | progression/race assignment surfaced through CharacterDisplaySnapshotService | actor_progression_state.race_id or character data | attributes/progression | race, world definitions | race mutation |
| Class/class track | Partial | progression/class-track assignment surfaced through CharacterDisplaySnapshotService | actor_progression_state primary_class_id/primary_class_track_id or character data | progression/abilities | class,class track, world definitions | class mutation |
| Level/XP/TNL | Implemented | ProgressionDisplayAdapter/ProgressionService | actor_progression_state or legacy character fields | leveling | progression | XP/level mutation |
| Age/birthday | Partial | snapshot age provider | character birth fields plus world calendar when available | calendar/lifecycle | birth state, calendar | calendar/birth mutation |
| Carrying | Implemented | CombatStatService carrying snapshot / CarryingDisplaySource | inventory/equipment runtime | encumbrance | carrying,equipment,inventory | item/equipment mutation |

| Play time | Implemented | session lifecycle snapshot time | accumulated played seconds plus active session | session accounting | play-time display generation | session tick/save |
| Status/survival/conditions | Partial | actor runtime/survival snapshot | actor posture/survival state | movement/combat/survival | position,target,hunger,thirst,intoxication | actor/survival mutation |
| Summonable/show VNUMs | Partial | player preference authority | preferences/identity snapshot | summon permission/builder display | preferences | preference mutation |
| Immortal poof/builder zone | Partial | identity and Builder editing context snapshot | character prefs/builder context | immortal movement/builder | poof text,builder zone | preference/builder mutation |

## Golden fixture coverage

Implemented focused coverage: framed width, left-aligned title, exact dividers and blank rows, no HP/Mana/Move/Alignment row, no modern sections, no unavailable/not implemented placeholders, fixed currency order, numeric spell saves, zero/normal play-time formatting, immortal poof and Builder zone rows.

Partial remaining fixture expansion: separate complete-string cases for every requested encumbrance threshold, active quest VNUM, birthday, sitting/fighting, condition notices, and transport visible-text equivalence.

## Windows testing status

Not run in this Linux container. Manual Windows acceptance should enter existing `Kraevok`, run `score`, and compare visible text after stripping ANSI/HTML to the fixed 81-column contract. No SQLite reset, world recreation, or character recreation is required by this code change.

## Remaining differences

Partial: canonical persisted Kraevok data was not present in this container, so no one-time repair command was applied. If live Windows Kraevok still lacks race/class/birth fields, use existing progression/admin tools to assign valid world definitions without changing the renderer. Valid IDs must be selected from `data/worlds/shattered_realms` progression definitions in the target checkout.

## 2026-07-14 SCORE identity regression repair

### Failure

Live `sc`/`score` could expose the internal projection exception `score_projection_incomplete field=identity.race` when an existing character had no runtime `race_name` and the display snapshot had not resolved canonical progression IDs.

### Root cause

The SCORE formatter correctly requires complete fields, but `CharacterDisplaySnapshotService` populated Race and Class from transient runtime fields (`race_name`, `race`, `class_name`, `character_class`, `char_class`) instead of resolving the durable `actor_progression_state` row. Legacy characters whose canonical row was missing identity IDs, or whose runtime object had only legacy/raw IDs, therefore produced an incomplete SCORE projection.

### Canonical identity sourcing

`ProgressionService.get_actor_progression(character_id, "player")` is the single SCORE snapshot query for progression state. `ProgressionService.progression_identity_snapshot()` resolves:

- `race_id` through `ProgressionContent.get("race_profiles", race_id)` and displays the definition `name`.
- `primary_class_id` through `ProgressionContent.get("class_profiles", primary_class_id)` and displays the base class definition `name`.
- `primary_class_track_id` through `class_tracks`; the track must belong to the selected class before its player-facing name can become the display class name.
- `species_id` through `species_profiles` for validation and future gameplay.

### Legacy migration behavior

Character entry calls the idempotent legacy progression repair before SCORE prewarm. The repair preserves an existing valid canonical row, then reads valid legacy `race_id`, `primary_class_id`, `class_id`, class/profession, and track IDs from the character record/actor data, then falls back to the validated `player_starter` progression profile only when no valid legacy value exists. It records migration metadata in `actor_progression_state.metadata_json` and never rewrites inventory, equipment, currencies, quests, room, effects, role, level, or experience.

Admins can inspect or explicitly run the same repair path in-game:

- `progressioninspect char_shattered_realms_kraevok`
- `progressionrepair char_shattered_realms_kraevok --dry-run`
- `progressionrepair char_shattered_realms_kraevok --apply`

Automatic character-entry migration should repair Kraevok; use the apply form only if inspection shows an unrepaired row after re-entering.

### Player-facing error boundary

Normal players no longer receive raw `score_projection_incomplete ...` text. If SCORE still encounters an incomplete projection, the command logs character ID, world ID, entry ID, projection generation, and missing field server-side and returns: `Your character data could not be loaded completely. Please contact an administrator.` Failed builds are marked failed and are not cached as valid SCORE content.

### Cache invalidation behavior

SCORE cache keys and invalidation now include progression identity and birth-state dependencies in addition to existing character, progression, currency, inventory, equipment, effects, location, and world-definition dependencies. Character-entry identity repair invalidates identity-dependent projections before SCORE is rebuilt.

### Kraevok verification status

Linux focused tests include Kraevok-like legacy identity repair and SCORE rendering through canonical definitions. Windows acceptance was not run in this container. Tony should verify on Windows with the existing world and existing `char_shattered_realms_kraevok` character.

### Windows acceptance steps

1. Stop Smart MUD.
2. Open PowerShell and run `cd "C:\Users\antho\Desktop\Smart MUD\smartmud-main-v2\smartmud-main-v2"`.
3. Pull or update the `main-v2` branch.
4. Start Smart MUD.
5. Log into the existing account.
6. Enter Kraevok (`char_shattered_realms_kraevok`).
7. Type `score` or `sc`.
8. Confirm a complete framed SCORE sheet appears.
9. Confirm no `score_projection_incomplete` text appears.
10. Type `score` again.
11. Confirm the second call remains correct and uses the cache.
12. Run `progressioninspect char_shattered_realms_kraevok`.
13. Confirm resolved race ID/name, class ID/name, and track are valid.
14. Restart Smart MUD.
15. Re-enter Kraevok and confirm repaired identity persists.

### Remaining partial systems

Calendar aging remains a lifecycle compatibility value rather than a complete world-calendar feature. Survival displays consume canonical/display-authority values initialized during entry for legacy characters; broader survival simulation remains documented in survival-system docs. HP, Mana, Move, and Alignment remain omitted from normal SCORE by the approved parity contract.
